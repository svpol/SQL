# Type of Triangle

Source: https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/what-type-of-triangle/problem?isFullScreen=true

Write a query identifying the type of each record in the TRIANGLES table using its three side lengths. Output one of the following statements for each record in the table:

Equilateral: It's a triangle with 3 sides of equal length.
Isosceles: It's a triangle with 2 sides of equal length.
Scalene: It's a triangle with 3 sides of differing lengths.
Not A Triangle: The given values of A, B, and C don't form a triangle.

Input Format

The TRIANGLES table is described as follows:

***Input Format***  
  
The TRIANGLES table is described as follows:  
  
+--------+---------+
| Column | Type    |
+--------+---------+
| A      | Integer |
+--------+---------+
| B      | Integer |
+--------+---------+
| C      | Integer |
+--------+---------+
  
***Solution***   

```
SELECT
  CASE 
    WHEN A + B <= C or A + C <= B or B + C <= A THEN 'Not A Triangle'
    WHEN A = B and B = C THEN 'Equilateral'
    WHEN A = B or A = C or B = C THEN 'Isosceles'
    WHEN A <> B and B <> C THEN 'Scalene'
  END tuple
FROM TRIANGLES;
```
